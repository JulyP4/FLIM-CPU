# FLIM-CPU

FLIM-CPU is a desktop application for processing fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) data. It delivers CPU-based data loading, analysis, and visualization so researchers can reliably reproduce experiments and explore datasets on standard hardware.

Official releases are published on GitHub: <https://github.com/JulyP4/FLIM-CPU/releases>.

Comprehensive usage instructions, algorithm notes, and UI walkthroughs are published in the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/JulyP4/FLIM-CPU/wiki).

## Key Features

- Manage and analyse multiple regions of interest (ROIs) within a single workflow.
- Inspect FLIM datasets through an interactive visualization interface that supports result review and presentation.

## Usage

1. Download the latest version from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/JulyP4/FLIM-CPU/releases).
2. Follow the release notes for platform-specific setup details.

## Support

If you cannot resolve an error, please capture the full log and open an issue in this repository, or contact the maintainer at <ruoyu.jiang@ntu.edu.sg> for assistance.

## Roadmap

- Ongoing optimizations to support additional image formats and expand data-processing capabilities.
- Planned development of an IRF deconvolution algorithm to improve analysis accuracy.
- Long-term goals:
  - Introduce GPU acceleration to increase throughput.
  - Deploy a server-hosted web application.
  - Integrate the platform into an AI system that combines imaging and other biological data for automated information synthesis.

Stay tuned for future updates and contributions!
